# Assignment-17.1

Problem Statement:

A test is conducted which is consisting of 20 MCQs (multiple choices questions) with
every MCQ having its four options out of which only one is correct. Determine the
probability that a person undertaking that test has answered exactly 5 questions wrong.

Solution:

n = 20, n - k = 5, k = 20 - 5 = 15

probability of giving a right answer = s = 1/4
probability of giving a wrong answer = 1 - s = 1 - 1/4= 3/4

So, P (exactly 5 out of 20 answers incorrect) = C (20, 5) * (1/4) ^15 * (3/4)^ 5

P (5 out of 20) = (20∗19∗18∗17∗16)/(5∗4∗3∗2∗1) * (1/4)^15 * (3/4)^5

= 0.0000034 (approx.)
